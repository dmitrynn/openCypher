Feature: Match1 - Zero-length patterns

  Background:
    Given an empty graph

  Scenario: [1] Matching all nodes of an empty graph
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n)
      RETURN n
      """
    Then the result should be:
      | n |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [2] Matching all nodes
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (:A), (:B)
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n)
      RETURN n
      """
    Then the result should be:
      | n    |
      | (:A) |
      | (:B) |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [3] Matching nodes using multiple labels
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (:A:B:C), (:A:B), (:A:C), (:B:C),
             (:A), (:B), (:C)
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (a:A:B:C)
      RETURN a
      """
    Then the result should be:
      | a        |
      | (:A:B:C) |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [4] Simple node property predicate
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ({name: 'bar'})
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n)
      WHERE n.name = 'bar'
      RETURN n
      """
    Then the result should be:
      | n               |
      | ({name: 'bar'}) |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [5] Returning a node property value
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ({num: 1})
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (a)
      RETURN a.num
      """
    Then the result should be:
      | a.num |
      | 1     |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [6] Returning multiple node property values
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ({name: 'Philip J. Fry', age: 2046, seasons: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]})
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (a)
      RETURN a.name, a.age, a.seasons
      """
    Then the result should be:
      | a.name          | a.age | a.seasons             |
      | 'Philip J. Fry' | 2046  | [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] |

  Scenario: [7] Handle OR in the WHERE clause
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (a:A {p1: 12}),
        (b:B {p2: 13}),
        (c:C)
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n)
      WHERE n.p1 = 12 OR n.p2 = 13
      RETURN n
      """
    Then the result should be:
      | n             |
      | (:A {p1: 12}) |
      | (:B {p2: 13}) |
    And no side effects
